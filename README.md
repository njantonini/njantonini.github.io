2. A brief description of your Github account: 
        My Github account is not a new account. It has been used in the past for a C++ class. It only had one repository for a group project, but I have since deleted that repository to make a fresh home page for myself.
3. A brief description of the repository you created: 
        The repository I created for this assignment is labeled njantonini.github.io. It will be used for this assignment to familiarize me with the uses of git and source control.
4. A brief description of the steps you took to clone the repository onto your local machine: 
        When on my local Github application, there is a "current repository" drop-down that allows you to clone a repositoy from the main Github server. I cloned the main and added it to my local list.
